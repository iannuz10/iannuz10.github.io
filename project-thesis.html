                    <h2>The Challenge (Situation & Task)</h2>
                    <p>
                        Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) are a promising form of human augmentation, but their widespread adoption is hindered by challenges in designing intuitive control schemes and inducing a strong sense of embodiment in users. A significant bottleneck in the field is the lack of standardized, cost-effective, and adaptable platforms for systematic experimentation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The primary goal of this thesis was to address this gap by developing and validating a modular, high-fidelity Virtual Reality environment to serve as a standardized testbed for SRL research. The objective was to create a platform capable of systematically comparing different robotic assistance paradigms and their effects on user performance, workload, and subjective experience.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>My Solution (Action)</h2>
                    <p>
                        To tackle this challenge, I designed and built a complete VR application from the ground up using <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>. The development process involved several key actions:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>VR Environment Creation:</strong> I developed a realistic and interactive virtual environment centered around a complex multi-step assembly task (building a stool). This included implementing a robust physics-based interaction system for object manipulation, part attachment, and functional tool usage (hammer, screwdriver, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>System & Control Implementation:</strong> I implemented multiple SRL control strategies, with a primary focus on an autonomous assistant driven by a Finite State Machine (FSM) that could proactively help the user by handling parts and tools.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Study Design & Execution:</strong> I conducted a formal within-subjects user study with 24 participants. The experiment compared performance and user experience across three distinct conditions: (1) working unassisted, (2) collaborating with the autonomous wearable SRL, and (3) collaborating with an autonomous external cobot.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> I collected and processed a rich dataset, including objective performance metrics (completion time, 3D hand path data, error counts) and subjective feedback from validated questionnaires (NASA-TLX, UEQ-S, VEQ). Custom Python scripts were written for detailed statistical analysis.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Results & Takeaways (Result)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The study yielded several significant findings that contribute to the field of human-robot interaction:
                    </p>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Performance Boost:</strong> Both the SRL and Cobot assistants led to significantly faster task completion times, reduced physical effort (shorter hand paths, smaller workspace), and lower perceived workload compared to working alone.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Superiority of Wearable Systems:</strong> While functionally equivalent, users showed a clear subjective preference for the wearable SRL. It was perceived as significantly more "inventive," "lifelike," and "intelligent" than the external cobot, resulting in a more engaging user experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Embodiment of an Autonomous Agent:</strong> A key discovery was that users reported a strong sense of <strong>Ownership</strong> and, counterintuitively, <strong>Agency</strong> over the SRLs, despite having no direct manual control. This suggests that predictable, task-relevant autonomous behavior can generate a powerful feeling of control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Embodiment as a Driver of Preference:</strong> Further analysis revealed that this sense of embodiment was a key predictor of user preference. Participants who felt a stronger connection to the SRL were significantly more likely to prefer it, highlighting that subjective feeling is as important as objective performance.</li>
