                    <h2>The Challenge (Situation & Task)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The success of In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) heavily depends on the quality of the oocyte (egg cell), but its assessment is a highly subjective process led by embryologists. This lack of objectivity can lead to inconsistent outcomes. The goal of my research fellowship was to investigate how Artificial Intelligence could bring standardization and data-driven insights to this critical step of the IVF workflow.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>My Contributions (Action)</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the fellowship, I undertook a multi-faceted approach, leading three core initiatives from conception to completion:
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>1. Systematic Literature Review & Publication</h3>
                    <p>
                        I conducted a rigorous, systematic review of all existing literature on the application of AI to oocyte quality assessment. This involved defining research questions, formulating database queries, and applying a multi-stage screening and quality assessment process following PRISMA guidelines. The synthesis of this research formed the basis of a scientific paper.
                        <br><strong>Outcome:</strong> I was the first author of the peer-reviewed paper <strong>"On the role of artificial intelligence in analysing oocytes during in vitro fertilisation procedures,"</strong> published in the Elsevier journal <em>Artificial Intelligence in Medicine</em>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Data Labeling Web Application (Project: MMS)</h3>
                    <p>
                        A major challenge identified in the research is the lack of high-quality, annotated datasets for training AI models. To address this, I developed <strong>MMS (Mouse Maturation Stage)</strong>, a full-stack web application that provides a user-friendly interface for embryologists to upload and label videos of oocyte maturation.
                        <br>Built with a <strong>Python/Flask</strong> backend and a standard <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> frontend, this tool was crucial for creating the structured, labeled dataset required for the next phase of the project.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. AI Model Development (Project: AI4Fertility)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using the data annotated with the MMS tool, I developed a machine learning pipeline to automatically classify the maturation stage of oocytes from video frames. My process involved:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Image Pre-processing:</strong> Using <strong>OpenCV</strong> in Python to segment oocytes, normalize images, and extract key regions of interest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Model Architecture:</strong> Designing and implementing a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> using TensorFlow/Keras, tailored for this specific image classification task.</li>
                        <li><strong>Training & Validation:</strong> Training the model on the labeled dataset and validating its performance, creating a proof-of-concept for automated, objective oocyte analysis.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Results & Takeaways (Result)</h2>
                    <p>
                        This fellowship successfully demonstrated an end-to-end process for applying AI in a complex medical domain. The published paper contributes a needed formal review to the academic community. The MMS web application provides a valuable tool for future data collection, and the AI4Fertility project serves as a strong proof-of-concept that data-driven methods, particularly CNNs, can bring much-needed objectivity to IVF procedures.
